# hello-world
My first repository on Git Hub and hopefully the beginning of my journey into programming.

In December 2015, I graduated from the University of Mississippi with degrees in Finance and Economics. Since then I really haven't covered much ground with regards to starting a career. I'm hoping that learning Python and eventually other programming languages will help me along the way. Maybe just maybe I can redirect myself and go into a different field than the ones I went to school for. That would be pretty awesome!
